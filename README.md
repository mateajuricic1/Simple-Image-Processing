# Simple-Image-Processing
University course project - Designing Digital Systems (in Verilog)

The task of this project is to implement a simple image processing on Xilinx Spartan-3E board using Verilog. 
Specifically, the user selects the desired effect using switches on the development board, which is then applied to a 30x30 pixel resolution image 
that is loaded into the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). The processed image result is transmitted to a computer via UART 
(Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter), and with the help of Python scripts, the processed image can be viewed.
